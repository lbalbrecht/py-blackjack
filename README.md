# Blackjack

## Description

A text-based Blackjack game built in Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

Upon program initialization, the player will be prompted to enter their name and may choose whether to play alone or with computer players. The program will deal two cards to all players (including the dealer) from a shuffled deck generated via Python's 'random' library. From there, the user will be prompted to place a bet (user starts with $50); if the user bets, the game will continue and the user will be prompted whether to 'hit' or 'stay.'<br>
At present, the user must enter 'hit' or 'stay' to proceed<br>
The game will run using standard Blackjack rules. At the end, the final scores will be announced and the player will be asked whether or not they wish to play again. The current record and earnings will be recorded so long as the player continues playing.

## Future Development
* Implementing a Double Down and Split Pair options for expanded game functionality
* Integrating the program into a webpage to add graphics
* Store user records and earnings between sessions
